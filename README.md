CPSC 349 - Web Front-End Engineering
Exercise 1
What are we trying to accomplish?
In this exercise, we will be familiar with HTML elements by creating a personal website.
Overview
1. The content is up to you, but I expect it to be tasteful! Describe yourself and tell us
something that interests you. Perhaps give a recipe you enjoy, a favorite movie or
hobby, a book you have read more than once!
2. Your site should have two or three pages, and these pages should be linked so that a
visitor can reach all of the pages on your site.
3. You need to have at least 30 different HTML elements.
4. You will use an on-line HTML validator to verify that your webpages are
correct. Screenshots of the validator report are part of your submission.
5. To complete the assignment, submit to Canvas your HTML files, screen shots from the
Validator, and the link to your deployed site (in a little text document).
6. Note: For this assignment, do not include any styling or scripting on your site, only
HTML.
Getting Started
A. You can write your webpages using your favorite text editor.
o Create a directory on your computer, then add your HTML files to this directory.
o Be sure that your 'main' file is called index.html.
o You can view your results by double-clicking one of the html files. Your computer
should start up your web browser, then render your page(s).
B. When you are done with a page, validate your work using an on-line HTML validator:
Capture a screenshot of the results, which will be part of your submission. Save these
images as PNG files.
C. To post your pages on the web, you may want to use Netlify or Github Pages as
described in class.

Exercise 2
What are we trying to accomplish?
This exercise is a continuation of Exercise 1. Here, you will add styling to your personal website
and make it responsive.
Overview
1. Every styling must be done one external stylesheets. No internal stylesheet and definitely no
inline styling!
2. Your website should be responsive. This means if I resize your browser or change the
screen device, the pages and layout should behave such that contents are still shown
effectively maximum display size to ensure usability and satisfaction.
3. You must apply at least 40 unique CSS properties!
4. You will use an on-line CSS validator to verify that your webpages are correct. Screenshots
of the validator report for each external stylesheet are part of your submission.
5. Once your pages are finished, upload them to a web server so it's live on the internet! You
may choose any method you'd like but in class I had shown how to deploy in Netlify and
Github pages.
6. To complete the assignment, submit to Canvas your screenshots from the Validator, a link
to your Github repo, and the link to your website under the Comment box in the submission
or on a text file.
7. Note: For this assignment, do not include any scripting on your site and do not use any
CSS library.
Getting Started
A. You can write your CSS file using your favorite text editor.
o Clicking the CSS file will not bring up the browser!
o Use Flexbox or Grid to make your website responsive for different viewports.
o Be sure to make the website responsive. You can achieve this through the @media
annotations.
o Have at least 40 unique CSS properties. I have a program that will check for this.
B. When you are done with a page, validate your work using an on-line CSS validator:

Capture a screenshot of the results, which will be part of your submission. Save this image
as a PNG file.
C. Upload your work to some space on the internet where I can view the pages and styles. I
would suggest to pushing your code to Github for example and deploying using free hosting 
platforms like Netlify or Vercel.

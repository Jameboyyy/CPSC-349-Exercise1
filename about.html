            <h3>Hello Everyone!</h3>
            <p>My name is <b>James Cadavona</b>!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am in my 5th and <strong>final</strong> year as a Computer Science
                major. My dream is to become a <mark>Front End Developer</mark>, specialized in
                three JS using React. I also aim to become a Full Stack Developer
                later in my career. Some hobbies I like to do are dancing and playing
                video games. Last semester, I was in a dance team previously called "Project Titan" here at CSUF,
                 now current called "Koi Dance Company". I was actually captain for the year and it was
                 amazing experience. My favorite games are League of Legends and Fifa 23. I am also into cars.
                 Working on them, driving them and spending money on them. I currently
                  own a 2000 Acura Integra GS and I love taking it for late night rides.
                  Hoping to get along with everyone in the class!

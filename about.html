                    <p class="about__text">I am in my 5th and <strong>final</strong> year as a Computer Science
                        major. My dream is to become a <mark>Front End Developer</mark>, specialized in
                        three JS using React. I also aim to become a Full Stack Developer
                        later in my career. Some hobbies I like to do are dancing and playing
                        video games. Last semester, I was in a dance team previously called "Project Titan" here at CSUF,
                         now current called "Koi Dance Company". I was actually captain for the year and it was
                         amazing experience. My favorite games are League of Legends and Fifa 23. I am also into cars.
                         Working on them, driving them and spending money on them. I currently
                          own a 2000 Acura Integra GS and I love taking it for late night rides.
                          Hoping to get along with everyone in the class!
